# Your rule content
- ## 1. Syntax Restrictions
- **No Template Strings**: Must use string concatenation (e.g., `"a" + b + "c"`) instead of template literals, as the environment may not support ES6 features [[User Rule]].
- **Avoid ES6+ Syntax**: For compatibility, it is recommended to use ES5 syntax (e.g., `var` instead of `let/const`, function expressions instead of arrow functions) [[4]].
